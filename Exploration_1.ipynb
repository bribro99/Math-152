        "In this exploration we will be working with the 3n+1 conjecture, also known as the Collatz conjecture, to see how different numbers behave with this conjecture. The conjecture says that for a positive starting value n we can calculate the next value in an infinite sequence such that the sequence ends in a cycle {4, 2, 1}, where we divide by 2 if n is even, or substitute n with 3n+1 if n is odd. In the case n=3, this sequence can be denoted as {3, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1, ...} where the cycle {4, 2, 1} repeats infinitely many times at the end of the sequence since 4 comes up in the sequence again after 1.Thus the conjecture holds for n=3. The process for calculating terms in the sequence is represented by the code below for start of the sequence n where the sequence terminates when n=1 since the rest of the sequence will consist of the cycle {4, 2, 1} repeated infinitely many times.

        "Now, consider the dropping times for numbers of the form $8k + 3$. We call the sequence of dropping times obtained the \"dropping sequence for $8k+3$\". We can see that this sequence is of the form $6,8,6,x_1,6,8,6,x_2, \\dots$, where $x_i$ is some integer. This sequence can be decomposed into a \"regular part\" and an \"irregular part\" by examining the dropping sequences for $16k + 3$ and $16k + 11$, which are respectively the even and odd terms of the dropping sequence for $8k+ 3$. This tells us that numbers of the form $16k + 3$ always drop after $6$ terms, which can be shown using a similar computation as in the previous paragraph. The dropping sequence for $16k + 11$ is then given by $8, x_1, 8, x_2, \\dots$. We can do the same trick and split the droppng sequence for $16k + 11$ into a \"regular\" and \"irregular\" part by examining the dropping sequences for $32k + 11$ and $32k + 27$. The dropping sequence for $32k + 11$ is $8,8,8, \\dots$, and we can once again manually check that numbers of the form $32k + 11$ will always drop after 8 steps. \n",

Looking at many terms of the sequence, we can again find signs of regularity; for example, the 2nd, 6th, 10th, etc. terms of the sequence are all 11. This suggests that if we continue \"splitting\" these sequences by looking at dropping sequences for $2^k + j$, for higher and higher values of $k$, they would continue to decompose into regular and irregular subsequences. This inspires us to make the following conjecture:\n",

The previous discussion shows that if $n = 5$, we may take $d = 2$, because all integers congruent to $1 \\pmod{4}$ have dropping time 2, and if $n = 11$, we can take $ d = 5$, because all integers congruent to $11 \\pmod{32}$ have dropping time 8. Using the process outlined above, we can search for values of $d$ for specific $n$ by increasing $d$ and seeing if the dropping sequence for $2^d \\cdot k + n$ becomes constant, but proving or disproving this conjecture in general seems quite difficult."

Here, if $f$ is a modified Collatz function, we define a \"loop\" to be the sequence of values obtained starting with $n$, whenever $f^k(n) = n$ for some $k > 1$.

        "The values of $k$ we found which have exactly one loop suggest that it is precisely the powers of 3 which result in a unique loop. Some thought reveals why powers of 3 behave in the same way: Let $f = C_{3^m}$ be defined as above, and let $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$, with $n = 3^kj$, where $GCD(3,j) = 1$. If $k < m$, then we will have \n",
        "$$f(n) = 3n + 3^m = 3^{k+1}j + 3^m = 3^{k+1}j'$$\n",
        "where $j' = j + 3^{m-k-1}$ is relatively prime to 3, so applying $f$ to $n$ increased the highest power of $3$ dividing $n$ by one. Then, if $n = 3^mj$, we have \n",
        "$$ f(n) = 3n + 3^m = 3^{m+1}j + 3^m = 3^m(3j + 1) $$\n",
        "so we simply obtain the usual Collatz function, with an extra factor of 3^m. Therefore, beyond the first few terms, the behavior of $C_{3^m}$ will be identival to the behavior of the regular Collatz function $C_1$, so we expect the number of loops to be the same. Indeed, we can see below that all values of $k$ of the form $5\\cdot 3^i$ appear to have 6 distinct loops, which we would expect given the previous discussion. "

        "We started by showing that for a sufficiently large n, say n=1000000, that the Collatz conjecture holds since for every positive integer n up to 1000000 the cycle {4, 2, 1} appears at some point in the infinite sequence created from n, and repeats infinitely many times once showing up. Then, we found that the infinite sequences behave differently for integers less than or equal to 0. For example n=0 will result in a trivial sequence {0, 0, 0, ...}, and depending on the negative integer n chosen, the infinite sequence will \"end\" in one of several different cycles repeated infinitely many times. In conclusion, we found that for a positive integer n greater than or equal to 2, that there exists an integer $d$ such that the following claim holds true for dropping time with respect to values satisfying the Collatz conjecture:\r\n",
